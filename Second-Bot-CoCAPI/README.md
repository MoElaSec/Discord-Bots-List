 to get general CoC player info & supports other Discord commands

## Side Notes:
regarding the `bot-ino.txt`
- Fill the `bot-ino.txt` with all the needed data before running the script.
- Make sure not to write spaces since the code will read the file and use the '=' sign to create a python dictionary by separating values into key-value pairs.
